        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Student📚</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Jeff Lee. I am currently eighteen years old. I am a freshman at University of California Riverside. I currently reside in California, and I live in La Habra. As of right now, my major is Undeclared- Life Sciences. However, I am interested in computer science, business, and neuroscience. I am proficient in math and english. I took AP classes for both math and english in high school. I am currently in my Fall quarter at UCR, but I did attend HESA during the summer, so I’m not completely new to college. Currently, I am taking Math 9B, English 1A, and Intro to Computing. 
	I am not completely new to computer science, for I have taken AP Computer Science in high school. In terms of business, I am still relatively new. Intro to Computing is a class that satisfies the Pre-Business requirement, so it seems like I am a step ahead in terms of becoming a Pre-Business major.

<br><br>

        However, I would say that science still fascinates me more than business. I have watched a lot of science related videos in my past and have taken AP science classes. Neuroscience and psychology are aspects of science that interest me a lot, but I like a wide variety of sciences. In terms of my future, I would like to pursue any other career than a medical career. 
	Though I don’t have a lot of professional experience, I am open to working at part-time jobs, internships, etc. Outside of school, I like to play and watch basketball. I also play some video games. Most of the time, I am doing homework. I like to finish with my work for the day before taking a break. I also have to help my parents. My responsibilities include washing dishes, doing laundry, and taking care of my grandma who has dementia. Some nights when I have time, I watch movies with my family. To destress, I like to browse the web, listen to music, play games, and play basketball. 
<br><br>

        As a person, my strengths are getting decent grades, staying determined, and making goals. I try to learn from my past mistakes to improve myself as a person. My weaknesses are staying focused, both in terms of doing work and for my future, having a will to learn new things, being lazy, procrastinating, and managing my time. These are just vague ideas of my strengths and weaknesses that I could think of at the current moment. 
	In terms of my personality, I am pretty shy. I don’t really have any friends. Most of the time, I just hang out with my twin brother and spend time with my family. However, I have experience with public speaking, for I have taken a public speaking class during the summer, so I am not too uncomfortable doing presentations.
	Lastly, this Bio is still very much a work in progress, and I am going to try to improve my resume the best that I can going into the future.
